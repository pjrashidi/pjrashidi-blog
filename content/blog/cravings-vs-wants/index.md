This is a valuable distinction to make. Let's take an example. Say, someone trying to cut sugar from their diet.

What they _want_ is to resist the temptation of sugar. To be healthier. To feel better.

Now, let that person walk by an ice cream stand. They might think to themselves "oh no, I really want ice cream right now, but I shouldn't."

I think this is a mistake. Seeing ice cream doesn't eliminate all that good stuff that they wanted before and just replace it with "I want ice cream"

They still want to cut sugar, be healthier, feel better. So then, its not that they really _want_ ice cream, it's that they are craving it.

This is better because it keeps us focused on what we want, and helps us recognize the opposite force for what it is - a passing craving that doesn't need to be fulfilled.
