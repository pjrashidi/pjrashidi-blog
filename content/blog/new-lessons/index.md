Yesterday brought 2 new lessons into sharper focus for me.

1. One act of self-disrespect can lead to many more.
   In this case, the first act was an unhealthy dinner. I had a bunch of chocolate and sugar, alongside some spaghetti. Nothing healthy there, especially bad because it was my only meal of the day.
   After this, the self-disrespect continued as I neglected my sleep and important tasks.

2. Other people's opinions are not more valid than mine.
   In this case, it was about reviews of some video games. I know already that I don't really like video games. I haven't been satisfied by a video game for years. And yet, I still get my hopes up when I read positive reviews for a game, as if all those other people's opinions somehow override mine.

In general, I find I have a habit of seeking other people's opinions on things almost in place of forming my own. For example, after watching a movie, or finding a new album, the first thing I do is jump on Reddit and read what other people think. I do it so immediately that I really give myself no time to form my own opinion, before diving into an ocean of everyone else's.

I don't know when this behavior started, but I find it rather sad and pitiable. I'm gonna do something about it.
