1. Learn what you want, not what you "should"
2. Learn however you enjoy it

This is different than how we're used to learning. School is all about learning the standard way, with heavy focus on rote memorization. But when we are learning on our own, we might as well learn something we enjoy, or what is even the point.

Focusing on speed and efficiency over enjoyment is a mistake too, since long term consistency is the name of the game for most things we want to learn. By enjoying the learning, we make it possible to keep at it, rather than getting demotivated and giving up.
