If you're curious about somethings, that's reason enough to try it. Even if people disapprove, or you're not 100% sure of how worthwhile it is.

If we only did things that came with a 100% satisfaction guarantee, we'd live a very small life indeed.

This isn't to say that you should do EVERYTHING you're curious about - just that if you're curious about something and want to do it, don't think you need more reason still.
