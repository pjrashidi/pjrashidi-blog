Creating your own belief system is a powerful ability we all have. It's also difficult. All our life we let our belief system be created by external forces. We are like a leaf on a river.

This is effortless. We don't have to think for ourself, we just let "truths" come to us.

What if those truths don't serve us. Will we let them hold us back from our greatest potential?

Can we choose to craft a new belief system for ourselves. Will it be "realistic"? Should it be?

What makes one belief system "better" than another. Scientific Accuracy? Utility? Joyfulness? Safety and Security?

Either you make that decision, or it's made for you.
