Is there a lifestyle change you've been putting off?

Is it kinda hard? The last times you've tried maybe you gave up and decided that "one day" you'll do it.

I sure know I have things like that.

Here's the question:

1. Do you believe you CAN do this thing?
2. Do you believe you WILL, at some point in your life, do this thing?

If the answer to both those questions is yes, then you might as well do it now. Presumably this change will make your life better, which is why you care enough to do it.

So why let yourself put it off for months, years, decades? The sooner you do it, the longer you will reap the benefits.

Here's the thing. If you CAN do it and WILL do it, then it's just a matter of when.

You will have to go through that process at some point, whether it's Today, or Today in 10 years.

There's no reason to put it off. Today is always Today. There is no salvation in the future.

You get more out of it if you do it today.
