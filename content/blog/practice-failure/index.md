title: Practice Failure

We like to give a lot of lip service to the idea of embracing failure. It's a big thing in business, personal development, etc.

And yet most people still do everything they can to avoid failure all the time. I'm guilty of this myself.

Even when writing this blog, I find myself getting strung up over word choice (strung up? Is that even a thing? ðŸ˜‰) or whether or not my metaphor is airtight.

No one reads this blog. There is absolutely 0 consequence for "failure" in conveying my message in a blog post.

I can use this as a practice then, for getting comfortable with failure. This and other low-consequence things are essential areas in which I can practice failure.

I wouldn't want to be laiz-e-fare (is that correct?) in a major life-changing thing, but here in this blog post, sure why not. There's no need to google lais-e-fair or whatever it is. That's a waste of time, AND a waste of an opportunity to get a little more comfortable with not being 100% perfect in everything I do.

So yeah. That's it. And here's my crappy outro ðŸ˜‰.
