title: Don't take him seriously

In your head is a voice. A voice of self doubt, self judgement. He pops up uninvited and tells you why you can't do that thing that you know you can and should do.

Some people hate that voice. They rage at it, try to silence it. They are making a mistake. They are taking the voice too seriously.

Treat the voice the way a king treats a court jester. Laugh at him. Accept him for what he is. And never take him seriously.
