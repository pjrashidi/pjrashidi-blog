Why pollute your mind with negativity? The world is already full of it. Your mind is already "primed" for it. That's why most people are so negative.

What a bleak way to live. So focused on the bad. You don't have to. You have a choice.

Of course, we're human, and we can't control our brains 100%. But we can at least choose not to intentionally fixate on negativity.

Some people pride themselves on their negativity. They are cynical, they see the nasty truth that others are oblivious or willfully ignorant too.

This gives them a feeling of superiority. They are superior, yes. They are on a mountaintop, cold and miserable.

The more you choose to tilt toward positivity, the more your brain will catch on with the program, and even your "uncontrolled" thoughts will start leaning more positive.
