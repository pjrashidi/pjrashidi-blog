title: Nothing Lasts

I'm traveling these days. I change locations every couple of weeks. Every time I begin a relationship (platonic and romantic), I know full well that it can't last very long because I'm leaving soon. This makes me less concerned with preserving the relationship. Normally I tend to worry about "messing things up", but now I don't really care because no matter what I do, it's not going to last.

This has given me some mental freedom. I am more openly myself, and think less about filtering or editing myself. I think this is a good thing, and increases the quality of my relationships.

Don't get me wrong, it's a pity for all your relationships to end quickly. But this is a sliver lining.

Taking this idea further, there's no reason not to ALWAYS apply this mentality. After all, even if you're not traveling the fact remains - nothing lasts. Maybe your relationship could last 2 years instead of 2 weeks. But it ends all the same.
