When you fail, you can see it in two ways.

1. This is evidence that I don't have what it takes, and will likely fail more in the future.
2. I have learned something new, gained some experience, and this improves my chance of success in the future.

When you fail consistently at something, it is natural to start to feel disheartened. Every new failure feels like another bit of proof that you just don't have what it takes.

But if you access this view, then you really make success impossible. Choose instead to think of it from the perspective of a weightlifter - where every failed rep gets them closer to the strength they need to succeed.

After all, both perspectives are valid, so why not pick the one that serves you.

Addiction may seems to be exempt from this positive view. Ever time you engage in an addictive behavior, you reinforce the neural pathways that are responsible for the addiction in the first place. So it seems like more failure would beget more failure.

However, you can also think of it from the perspective that more failure gives you more experience noticing the pattern of the addiction. Noticing what leads to it. What accelerates it. What makes it stop. You also can further reinforce the importance of stopping. This is all crucial so that you can use to your advantage as you manage the addiction.
