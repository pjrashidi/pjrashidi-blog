title: Remember, and be patient

There's two things you need to do.

1. You need to remember what you want. Review it every morning and night. Think about it during the day. Make sure that it never slips your mind for very long.

2. Be patient with yourself. Don't let impatience frustrate you and break your resolve. Your goals are grand and plentiful. Why do we get frustrated after just a few days, as if it's reasonable to expect that we turn everything around in such a short time.

All you have to do is stay on the track (by remembering which way you're trying to go) and be patient. You'll reach the destination eventually. You can rush if you like, walk faster, even run , but you may get tired and not enjoy the journey there as much.
