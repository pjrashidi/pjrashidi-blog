Look at your life, there's certainly some area where you're doing something for someone. It could be work, helping a friend, or any other situation where you're trying to make things better for another person.

I hope that you're doing out of free will, first of all. If you're not then this advice doesn't apply, and best of luck to you in escaping your servitude.

So anyway, you're already doing a service, and it's something you choose to do. Presumably because doing it is more valuable to you than _not_ doing it.

So can you do it a little better? Just dial up the quality a bit on something that matters to you? It will improve someone else's life, which is already good motivation. And it will benefit you too, in various ways.
