Life can be simple.

It depends on the stories we tell ourselves.

When something happens we can create a big twisting story out of it. Why it happened, what it means for now, what it means for the future. There's endless room for imagination here. We might never know for sure if the stories are accurate or (more importantly) useful.

This imagination and connection-making is where negative thoughts and beliefs get to run rampant an d turn a mountain into a molehill.

Another option is to make a TL:DR of the situation. Simplify it to the most basic form. The essence of what happened.

Then you can see it for what it is and move on without creating new baggage for yourself.
