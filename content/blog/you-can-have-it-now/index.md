That thing you want, you can have it now. Even if you don't really have it, if you imagine it in vivid detail in your mind, let yourself feel the emotions it would bring you, then for a brief period, you will have that thing.

Many people, myself included, can't hold that mental state for very long, especially at the same intensity of experiencing it in real life. That's why it feels like a cop out to say you can just imagine it and have it - because "it's not as good."

But if you try it, you can see that it's fundamentally true. If you can mentally and emotionally embody that experience of having what you want, in that moment it really is the same as having it.

Our perception of reality is all we know, and our perception just exists in our thoughts and feelings and senses.

There's also drugs and dreams. You can train yourself to lucid dream, and of course drugs can alter your perception to give you something stronger than what you even want in reality.

So if it's so simple to have what you want, then what? Why do it the hard way? I think it's because we want some form of permanence. Drugs and dreams and visualizations are fleeting.

We want that thing to be physically present, which gives it more permanence, gives us more time to spend with it, enjoying it from different angles, soaking it in.

It also feels more valuable because it's real. Maybe we want other people to see what we have too, so just having it in our head doesn't suffice.
