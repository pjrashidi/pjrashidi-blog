If you've decided that you don't want to do something, you need to stop doing it.

Every time you do it, you tell yourself that you want to do it.

Stop sending yourself mixed signals. If you don't want to do it, don't do it.

Be true to yourself. If your truth is that you don't want do it, then don't do it.
