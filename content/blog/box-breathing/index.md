Have you heard of this? I used box breathing last night to fall asleep when my body felt jittery. Breathe in 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, breathe out 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds.

It's a bit uncomfortable, but it engages the mind and body, and I did find it calmed me down a tiny bit. I also used it as practice breathing deeply through my diaphragm.

Try it out next time you want to engage your mind and body without any external things.
