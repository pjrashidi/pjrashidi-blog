When a project is nearing "completion" or a point where it's time to leave the safety of "under development" and expose the thing to the harsh, judgemental outside world, that's the time when it can be really tempting to scrap the project and jump to a shiny new one.

This is just fear, plain and simple.

It's safer to be in that early phase. You're still developing everything, you don't have any expectations for it to be great. Any problems can be brushed away with a simple "I'm still working on it"

But those who scrap and jump will never make an impact. Impact is for those who dare to ship.
