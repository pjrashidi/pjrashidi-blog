Save your fuel for yourself. You need it. I'm referring here to the fuel of your passions, your goals, your purpose.

When you have a desire for something, this is your fuel. That feeling of wanting something you don't have. It has fueled all of mankind for all of history. When you discover that you want something, and then set yourself to the task of getting that thing, you are aligned with your purpose.

And that feels amazing. You will feel so good about this alignment that you will want to tell anyone, _everyone_ all about this amazing thing you want and what you're doing to get there.

Doing this is a great way to kill your progress just as it starts. When you tell someone about your holy mission, it feels good. You feel a discharge of that inner powerful energy into the world. And that feels good, which is why we do it.

That lost energy is your driving force. It's your fuel. And now some of it is gone. Tell enough people, and you won't have enough left to go at all.
