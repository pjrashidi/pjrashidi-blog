If you stay in real life, you can do no wrong. You may be making mistakes, not getting what you want, etc. But if you're still in real life, you're still in the game. You're learning, growing, getting tougher and wiser and more experienced.

If you check out by burying yourself in artificial worlds, you are out of the game. You aren't getting any better at it. You're getting rusty at this game of life.

Take comfort in this. When real life is painful and hard to deal with, just remember that all you need to ask of yourself is to stay in the game. That's all you need to do to be a success.

You don't have to win all the time. Just play. Just stay.
