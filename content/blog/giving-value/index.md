Maybe a good mindset for the nervous aspiring entrepeneur is to focus on providing value above all else.

Not to focus on making money, or doing something new, or something that can scale. These are all good but maybe simply focusing on delivering real value to real people as directly as possible is the best start.

I can spend months or years building an app, and maybe partway through I run out of time or motivation and it never helps anyone.

Or I can write some blog posts this week that answer a very specific question for a small number of people a few months from now when it ranks. And maybe some of those people join my email list, and now I have gained something too. Much bigger impact there, and it can be leveraged into a monetized, new, scalable thing later.
