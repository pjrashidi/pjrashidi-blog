When you believe that something is hard, as in difficult, you make it harder. What does "hard" really mean to you?

"My chance of failure is higher than my chance of success"
"I'm not going to enjoy this"
"It might not be worth the effort"
"I might not have what it takes"

All these beliefs come bundled up with the belief of "This is hard"

In the face of all that pessimism, you might as well just give up, huh?

Forget about "hard". You don't have to believe in the concept if you don't want to. Instead of something being hard, it's just something that you haven't gotten used to. You need more time with it, more practice. That's it. Difficulty isn't part of the equation.
