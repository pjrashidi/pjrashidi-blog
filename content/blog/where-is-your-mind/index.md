Pay attention to where your mind is. What does it think about? What does it notice? What does it focus on?

Is it dwelling on things that matter?

I used to play a game on my phone that more or less rewarded me for walking away from the game for many hours and coming back to it later.

My first intuition would be that this is a good thing. I can engage with them game in small chunks throughout my day, and I have no icentive to get sucked into into it for long sessions.

In practice, I found something interesting. The game ended up becoming something of a frame for my life. A constant thread was running in my head, keeping track of how long it had been since I last touched the game.

Before sleeping, I'd check the game, knowing that if I set things up just right, I'd get huge benefit from the upcoming hours of sleep.

When I woke up, the first thing I did was check the game to make the most of the rewards waiting for me.

Every time block was now seen in the context of this game. It was like bookends for everything I did.

Now, this may seem extreme, and I'll be the first to admit that I get hooked on video games and the possibilities of maximising efficiency.

But it brought to my attention that we have to consider the "focus cost" of having something in our life.

That game, even if it ultimately took up 30 minutes in a day, was monopolizing so much of my mental focus even when I wasn't playing it.

It may not be so obvious to you right away what else is taking up more focus than its worth.

But set an intention for yourself to notice where your mind is, and you'll start to see it.
