Some distractions are pure bullshit. Much of reddit, video games, garbage tv, etc. Others still serve as stress relief, but have some value. Reading Hackernews instead of Reddit is a better alternative. Higher quality, potential for learning, less outrage. Watching a good, meaningful movie instead of a dumb action flick.

Now I'm going to a spa to relax.
