I think one of the most important things we can do is to decide what to hold on to, and what to let go of.

It's extremely important that we figure out WHAT is worth holding on to, and then hold on to that for dear life!

At the same time, we need to figure out what ISN'T worth holding on to, and let it go. Once you find out the important stuff, the rest falls in this category.

It's not something you can figure out just once. It constantly changes, and thus requires constant updating for you.

Something that matters now may stop mattering, and then you must switch from holding on to it, to letting it go.
