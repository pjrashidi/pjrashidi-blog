It's been about 3 weeks of Colemak practice now and I am still a bit slow and error-prone. But I am FAR better now than I used to be, this is for sure.

It's taking longer than I expected actually... I've logged 16 hours of dedicated typing practice. Sometimes it feels like I practice endlessly. But I kinda fall into a trance and don't get bored.

I think I'm getting close to some accelerating gains in speed and accuracy.

Backspace on Caps Lock is splendid. I am also customizing the finger placement a bit. The "standard" touch typing finger placement is bunk.

My Qwerty touch typing ability is gone. Interesting how quickly the brain overwrites years of ingrained habit like that. Maybe this says something about my ability to replace other habits.

Like if I replace my nail biting habit with a less destructive tic. I'd have to really dedicate myself to the tic in the same way that I've been dedicating myself to Colemak over the last 3 months.

It has to be close to nail biting so that it actually overrides the habit. Something with my hands. Something near my mouth? It's not ideal, since I want to keep my hands away from my face as much as possible. But doing something totally different might just create a new habit.

I'm trying to hijack the existing mental pathways and just change the output a little bit. I can try it out and see how it goes. Will report back later.
