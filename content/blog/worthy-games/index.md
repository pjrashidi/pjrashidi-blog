Humans play all kinds of games. From office politics to Monopoly to wars between nations. Today, most people playing video games.

Sometimes these games are worthwhile. A really well-crafted game is a work of art. Or a source of great fun and memories between friends. Often times they are just time killers, designed to addict and distract. It seems like that's becoming the main trend with mobile games.

When I stop playing a video game, it frees up that time and energy to play a new, different game.

It could be another video game, and nothing changes. Or it could be a game worth playing. It could be toying with a new programming language. Or taking on the challenging game of marketing something.

These are games, though they may seem like work. A game is just a system with rules, goals, challenges, interaction. You play inside that system, and try to do your best.

In a game like chess, you have complete information. You know all the rules, all the possibilities.

In a video game, millions of other people are also playing the game, and they have figured out all the information, it's all online. You can know everything.

But the best thing about "real life" games is that you don't know the rules, you don't have all the information. You get to figure it out as you go, and you even get to DECIDE these things, to some extent.

That's a lot better than retreading the same ground a hundred or a hundred million people have already tread in a sandbox of someone else's design.
