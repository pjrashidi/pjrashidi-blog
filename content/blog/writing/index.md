Writing is clarifying. It requires focus, and cultivates it. Writing your thoughts is so valuable. We should really write every day. It's underrated, but so useful. Fill a journal with your writings. Fill lots of journals. It clears the mind.

Right now my thoughts are pretty sporadic. Writing makes it a little better. But this is a public blog, so I can't just pour stream of conscious. That's what a notebook is for. Write fast, sloppy, and without any censorship. And once the notebook is full, throw it away and start again with a new one.

It's not about preserving the writing, it's just about doing it.
