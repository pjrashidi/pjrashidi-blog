Lead with empathy, even when it puts you at risk. It's better to be taken advantage of while being a kind person, than to protect your neck by being a heartless one.

It's also about creating a world you want to live in. If you want to push the needle towards distrust and selfishness then by all means, avoid empathy. But if you want things to be better than that, the most you can do is lead by example.
