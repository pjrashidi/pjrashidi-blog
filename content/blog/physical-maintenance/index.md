You can't get away with neglecting physical maintenance. We _think_ we can, subconsciously, because we can eat bad food and nothing seems to change, or we can stop working out and everything seems normal. But that's an illusion. Our bodies don't react instantly to good and bad inputs. They react gradual, and they are self regulating and adjusting. So it may take a while for the effects to show, and they may be subtle at first.

But to imagine that they won't show is pure delusion. It's like not changing a car's oil and thinking "well, it's still driving fine, must not be important"

We are physical beings. Animals, engines of flesh and blood and chemicals and electricity. As much as we try to ascend from our base animal form, we can never escape it. It is an ever-present foundation to every higher, nobler thing we do. It effects everything.

Never let yourself forget the importance of eating healthy, sleeping well, and exercising. Not just in a "oh yeah, I know, it's important, I'll get to it at some point..." No. It must be a top priority, or it will never be handled.

You have to trust yourself on this one. It's easy to feel like you can neglect these efforts for free. Like you can spend less time and effort on them and still get the same results. Don't buy that feeling. Remember what you know, and what you are. A bunch of cells working together, with basic chemical needs.

Don't neglect those needs. Respect yourself, love that engine inside you, and it will reward you for it.
