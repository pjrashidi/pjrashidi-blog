When things get tough, sometimes we think it's because we're in in the wrong place. But this is not necessarily true. Often times, that tough situation is exactly where we need to be. The place where we need to grow.

Accept that we get stronger when we endure and overcome a challenging time in life. And trust your instinct too.

There will be a part of you that desperately wants to run away from the situation, back to the welcoming arms of your comfort zone.

And hopefully the other part of you can be heard - the part that knows what matters more than comfort.

You know in your gut already which voice is which. And you can choose which one to listen to.
