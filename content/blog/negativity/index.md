Negativity is a poison that we make for ourselves. If we get pleasure from thinking negative thoughts about others, we don't realize the misery we perpetuate in ourselves. Even worse is to direct negativity at ourself. It's pure insanity really, when you think about it.

Where is negativity? In your head, that's all. It doesn't exist in the world. It's not a real thing, just an idea.

It's not real. You don't have to treat it like a real thing.
