I am experimenting with the Colemak keyboard layout. It is quite a lot nicer than QWERTY but it's definitely got a learning curve. It's taking me forever to write this post. But I also feel like I'm making an important investment that I will enjoy for the rest of my life.

I think a week or two of awkward typing will be worth decades of more comfortable typing. Maybe it will even prevent RSI.
