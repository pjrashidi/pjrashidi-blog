title: Ready to Fail

I talked about how things that are often thought of as "hard" are better seen as just taking time to get used to. "Hard" feels out of reach, but anyone can spend time getting used to something.

Today's post follows this track, in that when you are starting to get used to something, you have to be ready to fail. You have to EXPECT to fail.

A willingness to fail is necessary to keep you going. If failure makes you stop, then you won't put in the requisite time.

I'd even argue that a willingness to fail and keep going is the number #1 most valuable skill when trying to do something that you can't do now.

Here's the good news! Failing is EASY. ANYONE can fail. You can fail every day, multiple times a day.

Of course, the point isn't to fail. If your intention is failure, then you will probably get really good at failing, but never good at succeeding.

So I propose a different way of looking at things.

- Instead of this mindset:
  "This is hard"
  "I keep failing, this sucks"
  "I don't know if I have what it takes, maybe this isn't worth it"

- Take on this mindset:
  "Nothing is hard, it just takes getting used to"
  "I HAVE to fail before I get good at this, so it's not a bad thing"
  "I, like anyone else, am cabable of trying and failing"
  "All I have to worry about is to keep trying despite failure, the rest will sort itself out"

A note on timeframes:
You may be thinking to yourself "Ok that's great but I dont want to be stuck in try/fail pergatory forever, I want to be good! When do I quit?"

My response is to just stop thinking about it. Just like the concept of "hard" doesn't server you, neither does thinking about how long it's going to take.

If this task is worth doing, it's worth taking the time. You've got a lot of time! You can make amazing progress in just 1 year. Time is not the limiting factor.

Your mental state is the limiter, and thinking "This is taking too long" is a great way to ruin your mentality and stop your progress.
