You think you should multitask to be more productive. Watch TV while eating. Check your phone while in the bathroom.

Sure you might "get more done", but there is a cost here. The quality of both experiences suffer. You could have really enjoyed your food, but instead you barely noticed it. You could have given your racing mind a short break, but instead you kept racing with whatever is one your phone.

When you do just one thing, you do it better. And if that one thing doesn't need _all_ your mental capacity that's ok. Have a calm moment. You need it.
