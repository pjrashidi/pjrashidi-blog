Observe how things work, draw your own conclusions, test them, incorporate new learning. Be a _diligent_ student of life.

This isn't automatic. Most people will automatic learn from the opinions of others, from their own daydreams and misperceptions, or from "societal wisdom".

To learn directly from life - from the source - is a great thing.
