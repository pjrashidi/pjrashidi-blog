title: Shoot For Better

We often shoot for the top when we're still at the bottom. It's better to shoot for the next step up. Like a man at the bottom of a staircase who wishes he was at the top. He could climb the steps on by one, but that's no good. He doens't want to be on the second step, or the third step. No, he wants to be at the TOP and he wants to be there NOW.

You can see why this is a problem. When we fix our goal on the top, anything less becomes a failure. Failure makes us feel bad, so we create a lot of suffering for ourselves. Instead, focus on the next step, which can be seen as "getting to somewhere slightly better than where I am now".

By the way, this only applies to situations where the "top" is something that takes a lot of time and effort to reach, and we just haven't put in the time and effort yet.
