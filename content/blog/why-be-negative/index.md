Why be negative? Sit in that question. Why. What is the motivation?

Negativity doesn't have much appeal does it? Why embrace it?

Usually it's out of unconscious habit. We've been negative, all our lives, why stop now? Of course, that's not a good reason.

And it doesn't get to the root. Why did we start being negative?

Self defence. Being negative lets you hide, shirk responsibility, etc. It can be satisfying - being negative can make you feel superior, like a school bully who brings down others to lift themselves up.

You learn negativity from family, then friends and society. It's everywhere.

So what is negativity? Is sadness and angery negativity? No. Those are just emotions. They can be positive or negative. Negativity is not an emotion, it's a _perspective_.

Your perspective of one thing, many things, or the entire world. The past and the present and the future. The things you know, the things you don't. And of course, maybe most importantly, the people of the world.

Your perspective colors everything. And you have a choice. Will you color your world with negativity or positivity?

If you take comfort in rejecting the world and all its good possibilities, negativity is your tool. It will allow you to feel safe and "right" in your self righteousness.

But if you want to live a life of love and beauty, with a light spirit - then why be negative?
