There is too much bullshit. We are drowning in it. One simple way to improve the value of one's life is to develop a habit of skipping the bullshit.

Some examples of bullshit:

- reading the opinions of nameless, faceless, agenda-driven, and unqualified people on the internet
- playing games that are just Skinner Boxes designed to hook your brain
- doing soulless work for a shitty company that doesn't give a damn about you
- consuming uninspired tv, movies, etc just to pass time

So what's not bullshit?

- Spending time connecting with real human beings, especially ones that matter.
- Facing your demons.
- Experiencing the ups and downs of the human condition.
- Trying, failing, and succeeding.
- Observing the world around you.
- Making things a little better for someone.

It's not that we have to be perfectly efficient machines. Liesure is good. But it should be quality liesure, not bullshit liesure. We would do well to cut as much bullshit from life as is humanly possible. This is a simple rule to live by.
