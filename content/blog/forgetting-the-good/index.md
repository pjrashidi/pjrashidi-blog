A common source of unecessary suffering is a bias towards negativity. To forget the good but never the bad. Often times you feel like a bad thing today will continue indefinitely. And then it ends. But you don't learn the lession. Then the next time something bad happens, you again assume this is a curse that will follow you to the bitter end.

It takes strong mental presence to remember the good while you're surrounded by the bad. Practice when things aren't so bad.
