We like things that are low maintenance. Maintenance feels like a necessary evil that we strive to minimize and even eliminate wherever possible.

I think we can go overboard on the idea of low maintenance though.

Remember that maintenance is the way of life in this universe. Every organism is in a constant state of self maintenance.

Besides the automatic maintenance that is constantly keeping us alive, we do plenty of active maintenance without complaint.

We brush our teeth everyday, never feeling like our teeth are too "high maintenance". So why seek a one time solution in other areas, such as our wellbeing, or our relationships?

The more you look, the more life looks like a long series of various big and small maintenance cycles.

I like to think of a pencil. It's an elegant and effective tool, perfectly suited for it's purpose. And every few minutes, it must be sharpened. Does this maintenance requirement make the pencil a lesser tool?

For some people, yes. In pursuit of maximum efficiency, they switch to a mechanical pencil. Now the maintenance feels lessened, but it's still there, in different ways. And crucially, something is lost.

The break in work used to be a slow, satisfying crunch of wood, graphite, and blade. A faint smell and a small puff of particles as the tip is pulled out and inspected. The new sharp tip is placed against the paper, so delicate that gives a tiny audible snap, but it's fine, because now it has caught the paper and is leaving crisp dark marks again.

But use a mechanical, and you replace all that with a second of pause, a few frantic clicks, and you're off again.

Maybe that old pencil feels like a lot ot over-romanticizing of something that doesn't matter. You may be right. But I like to appreciate the little things, and see the magic where I can find it.

Even if that is in maintenance.
