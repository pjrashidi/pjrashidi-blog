"Don't ask for the advice of random people on the internet who most likly haven't accomplished the thing that you're trying to accomplish." - mattvsjapan

I read this comment on a forum about language learning. The guy who said it has succeeded massively in learning Japanese. All the other comments were discouraging, with only his being encouraging. And that proves his point.

If you ask for advice from the masses, you will recieve advice from people who aren't "qualified"!

You have no reason to listen to their advice, and it's going to be useless at best, counterproductive at worst. Don't ask.
