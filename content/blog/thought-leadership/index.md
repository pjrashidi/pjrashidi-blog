I hear this term all the time: "Thought Leader". I haven't really given it much thought, pun intended.

But now that I'm trying this forum fast, some new perspective has occured to me.

When you outsource your opinions and beliefs to the news, forums, or whatever other source, you're being a follower. You're giving up agency and lining up for someone else's worldview.

That worldview may be true or false, harmful or helpful, but either way, you're still being a follower. Being a follower isn't purely bad. Sometimes it makes sense to follow. So it's not a cardinal sin or anything.

But if you give yourself some space away from the masses of opinion spouting, highly biased, agenda driven parties, you can form your own opinions and worldview. It will be heavily influenced by the world around you of course - everything is. But it will be your own. Whether a million other people came to that same conclusion on something doesn't matter because you don't know, you just came to that yourself.

Maybe "thought-leadership" implies that your ideas are new and unique. Like you are pioneering new lands. But I think you can be a leader in well explored lands still.

When you form your own opinions rather than relying on others to supply them, you switch from a follower to a leader.
