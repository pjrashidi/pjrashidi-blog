Life is complicated. We want to be productive, focus on the high priority stuff, and squeeze in that gym session or morning meditation that we _really know we should be doing_.

But so often we get swept up in the rush. The day blurs by, a whirlwind of obligations and diversions. We feel a loss of agency over our own lives.

We tell ourselves that once it passes, we're going to get into a better routine, to stop this from happening. But then it passes and we relax, until it happens again.

We can't outwit chaos. It's going to come, and it's going to scatter our plans and routines like boats in a storm.

We need an anchor. Something that holds us in place during the storm so we can maintain some perspective while it rages, and so that when it's over we can continue from where we were, not dizzy and lost somewhere unfamiliar.

(By the way, I have no idea if actual boats in an actual storm benefit from an anchor, probably not huh?)

Here are the requirements for my metaphorical anchor:

- It must be reflective, not reactive
- It must be simple.
- It must be accessible, available anywhere and any time.
- It musn't take too long, or I will have to skip it on busy days (and those are the most important days).
- It shouldn't feel like too much of a chore
- It shouldn't be unhealthy, mentally or physically

And here are some ideas that fit my criteria:

- Taking a walk without my phone
- Write a page of my thoughts in a journal
- Sitting and listening to relaxing music - while doing nothing else
- Not taking my phone into the bathroom (let it be a natural break for my brain)
- Write/think about where I want my life to go
- Read an inspiring book

These are all good activities, but I can't expect do them all every day, it's too much to keep track of.

But if you at least do one or two of these every day, no matter what else happens, you will certainly stay more aligned with what matters in your life.
