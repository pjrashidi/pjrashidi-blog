title: What is going on?

Most of the time we don't really know what's going on. We go through the day on autopilot. Our mind chatters away on dreams, fears, and random nonsense most of the time. Sometimes there are practical thoughts: "I'm hungry now." "I should work on that thing today."

But we're almost never aware of what's going on _right now_.

What are we feeling below the chatter? How does our body feel? What is our environment like? How does this food taste. We're normally just aware enough to notice anything that stands out, that demands to be addressed. But we miss so much.

I bite my nails. It's a bad habit that I've tried to rid myself of many times. I believe awareness will help. Normally if I catch myself biting, I just put my hand down in frustration and go back to what I was doing. This never works. As soon as my attention shifts away, almost comedically, the hand comes back to my mouth.

I know that I bite my nails when I'm worried about something. So I can use the nailbiting as a cue to check in with my mind. Without lowering my hand, "What am I worried about? Ah, that. And that. Ok, let that worry go." And then I drop my hand, and with the worries gone, it doesn't come back up.

At least not immediately. But next time it does, I just do the same thing. In this way, the nailbiting becomes my ally, my reminder to be aware of what's going on.
