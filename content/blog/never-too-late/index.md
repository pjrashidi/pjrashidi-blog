It's never too late to do your best. It may be too late to do what you set out to do in the past, but that doesn't mean you should resign to your fate. In this moment, what is the best you can do. There's always something you can do now.

Yes there are missed opportunities from the past. You could have started that thing 10 years ago, and you'd be a master by now. Yes, it's too late for what you could have done differently in the past 10 minutes or 10 years.

But it's never too late to do what you can right now. And really, that's all you ever have the chance to do. Every decision in history that was or wasn't considered "too late" was made in a "right now" moment. It's the only way.
