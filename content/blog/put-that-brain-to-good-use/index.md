Do you have an active mind?

"I think I think too much"
\- Kanye West

An active mind is like a fast but wild horse. The potential is there but it's useless when untamed.

Writing is one way to tame it. This doesn't kill its speed and power. It just teaches it to use its power in service of something useful.

Useless horse analogy is over.

Writing trains the mind to think about what you write about.

After writing, the brain just keeps coming up with new idea connected to the topics you wrote about.

So if you write about something good and positive and useful, your thoughts will become more good, positive, and useful.
