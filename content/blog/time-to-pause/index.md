Little pauses are refreshing. They are a moment to check in with the present. To appreciate this little slice of time. For many people, this little slice of time is absolutely full of blessings that they would normally not even notice.

Long pauses are inspiring. They foster creativity. I think that's why we have great ideas in the shower.

In the effort to be productive, we strive to fill all our time. Even the little pauses are filled on our phones.

It seems like a minor thing, but I think we need to make pauses a priority.
