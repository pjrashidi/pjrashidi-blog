Inaction doesn't teach you much. Mindful action gives you a chance to fail or succeed. To be surprised or proven wrong. Of course, it must be mindful. Thrashing about wildly will do more harm than good. But mindful action, even if you're not sure if it's the right more, will do more for you than passivity.

Try your best. Take the first step, and the second. Accept the possibility that things won't go how you want. You will either succeed, or learn something.

Passivity is death for the spirit.
