Being great is a big scary concept. If you think to yourself, how do I want to live a great life, the thoughts are probably overwhelming. And faced with all that, your brain just goes "naaaah I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing"

But really, you just have to be great today. And even more that just today, be great now. It's like being on a diet. Think of someone who makes an exception for themself all the time "I know I'm on a diet but I'll just eat these sweets this one time". But they do it so often that they are just constantly eating unhealthy. Of course they fail at their diet.

If you want your life to be great, or even just better, the best and only way is to make right now better. Don't discount the importance of that one decision right now in front of you. Don't think you can just give this one up and let future you pick up the slack the next time you face that decision. There is no future you. There is only present you.

That decision you make right now, that is what decides you.
