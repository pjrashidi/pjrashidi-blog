They say showing up is 80% of the battle, and to be honest it's true. Showing up takes bravery. Sometimes we just want to skip it, stay in our comfort zone.

But showing up doesn't have to be so scary. Here's the thing. We expect that we have to do so much more than show up. We put the expectation on ourself to show up _like a superstar._

We expect some high performance from ourselves, and that makes it scary, because the pressure is too high. Especially when we are already intimidated by the idea of simple showing up.

Here's the thing. If showing up is scary, then it's good enough. It's exactly what you need to do and nothing more. If showing up is scary, then you don't need to worry about what you do after that - you're already facing your fear and you are a good student of life.

If you feel paralyzed from showing up in the way you think you _should_, find something that is easier and do that. Sit in that for as long as it takes to get comfortable. Eventually it might even get boring. That's great. Now you can ramp it up a little with something slightly scarier.

Another thing about showing up - You have every right to. You are a human just like everyone else, no less deserving of your space on this earth. So when you show up, do so with this knowledge.

Plant yourself firmly. Do what you want. If people don't like it, you already know where they can stick it.

We're all just a bunch of fancy monkeys who don't really know what we're doing. Don't fall for the illusion that everyone else has their shit figured out. So you're free to show up, the bar is far lower than you think, and you already qualify.
